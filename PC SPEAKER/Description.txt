Class for using the PC Speaker using VB and Assembly

Use it as you like and at your own risks. I am not responsible for
anything. After all, this is assembly! But give me a little credit
if you use this class in your apps. I am encouraged by the great
submissions to planet-source-code showing the techniques to use
assembly in VB. I decided to make something useful using assembly.

There is a API function in WinNT based systems - BeepAPI function.
You can create sounds of any frequency and for duration by using
that function. But the BeepAPI function in Win98 is very limited.
It can't do it. So, I made this class that can do the same work
in Win98 also. I haven't tested this code in other machines. But
it should work. Please, report to me if it doesn't work. My email
address is sakib039@hotmail.com

Don't forget to check all the other Assembly+VB submissions in
planet-source-code. And comments and votes on this thing are welcome.

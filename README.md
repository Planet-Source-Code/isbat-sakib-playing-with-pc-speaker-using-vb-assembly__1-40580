### Description

There is a API function in WinNT based systems - BeepAPI function. You can create sounds of any frequency and for duration by using that function. But the BeepAPI function in Win98 is very limited. It can't do it. So, I made this class in assembly that can do the same work in Win98 also. I haven't tested this code in other machines. But it should work. Please, report to me if it doesn't work. Comments and votes are welcome.
